## Chapter 5 examples:

- Hibernate l2 cache
- memoization
- MyBatis caching
- Web session clustering
- Spring boot (experimental)

Note that, **ignite-hibernate 5.1** version is not available in *maven central repository*. So, for modules **Hibernate** and **Memoization** you need to build them from the Apache Ignite source code and install in your local maven repository. Therefore, download the source code from the Apache Ignite site and follow the steps 1-9 from the chapter 2 section “Building from source code”. After completing the step 9, you should have installed all the required artifacts in your local repository.
